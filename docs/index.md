# 📂 File Formats in Science

**File Formats in Science** is a collaborative, open-source initiative to document the many file formats used across scientific disciplines. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and community-curated reference for understanding the origins, structures, standards, and implementations of scientific data formats.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Document the structure and usage of scientific file formats.
- Record format history, standards, and institutional affiliations.
- Provide language-specific usage examples and libraries.
- Promote transparency, accessibility, and interoperability in science.

## 📦 Repository Structure

This project uses **MkDocs** with the Material theme. Each file format has a dedicated page that includes:

- General format metadata (e.g., extensions, MIME type, standard).
- Usage examples in common programming languages.
- Historical context and institutional origin.
- Known issues and interoperability challenges.
- Links to specifications and tools.

## 🧩 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, archivists, and domain experts!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add or update a Markdown file in `docs/formats/` (use our template).
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your edits.

To contribute a new format, copy and adapt `docs/formats/template.md`.
